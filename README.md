# Asian Wok Online Ordering System

## Overview
This project is a custom **online ordering platform** built for **Asian Wok LLC** to reduce reliance on expensive third-party delivery services. It allows customers to browse the menu, customize items, add them to a cart, and securely place orders online. Orders are stored in a PostgreSQL database and displayed on a confirmation page for customer verification.

## Motivation
Previously, Asian Wok depended on third-party platforms that charged high fees and limited control over the ordering experience. By building a tailored in-house system, the restaurant can:
- Avoid third-party commission costs  
- Maintain full control over menu updates and promotions  
- Streamline order processing for staff  

## Features
- **Frontend:**  
  - Built with **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**  
  - Interactive menu with item options (e.g., size, spice level, add-ons)  
  - Dynamic cart with **live subtotal and tax calculation**  
  - Client-side **checkout form validation**  

- **Backend:**  
  - Developed using **Node.js and Express**  
  - **REST API routes** for order submission and retrieval  
  - Orders and order items persisted in a **PostgreSQL database**  
  - Server-side calculations for totals and confirmation numbers  

- **Order Confirmation:**  
  - Displays order summary, items, and totals  
  - Provides a confirmation number for customers and staff  

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL  

## Impact
This system improves order efficiency, gives the restaurant direct control over its online presence, and reduces long-term operational costs by eliminating third-party fees.
